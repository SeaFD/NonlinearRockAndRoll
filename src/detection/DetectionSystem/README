---Details---
The code in this repository is used to assess a real-time detection system for the occurrence of parametric resonance in a wave energy converter as detailed in the following publication:

	Davidson and Kalmar-Nagy, A real-time detection system for the onset of parametric resonance in wave 		energy converters, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 2020

There are two separate .m files, one to assess regular wave inputs and the other to assess irregular wave inputs.

---Requirements---
To run the code requiures Matlab and Simulink

---Funding---
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement number 867453
